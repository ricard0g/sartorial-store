# Shopify Theme Boilerplate 📦

Repo for personal use. Here we have the Barebones of a theme for Shopify.

## Includes ✍🏽

The basic Architecture and Folder structure needed for any Shopify theme to be connected with your store.

Files are not written, nothing is written, it's just a blank canvas.

From there we develop and start building.

## Folder Structure 🛖

Barebones needed for Theme Development.

```

|-- locales/
|-- sections/
|-- snippets/
|-- templates/
|-- .gitignore
|-- .prettierrc.json
|-- README.md
```
## Naming Convention of Files 📇

Every File is named following the naming that's followed inside the [Dawn Theme](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/tree/main).
